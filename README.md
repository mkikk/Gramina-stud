# Gramina-stud
Gramina Stud webpage. Done for real life use and for an assesment in "Introduction to computer sciences" course.
This webpage gives information about a stable located near Tartu, Estonia. The webpage is run on CSS, HTML and a little bit of JS.
It will have no framework and will probably stay as an alpha version for a live webpage.

Webpage was created by Markus Kikkatalo and Romet Vinnal.

Job distribution was divided by both creators. Romet's previous experience in webpage creating made him the supervisor and he made corrections where necessary. Markus gathered the neccesary data, provided the idea and developed as much as he was able to. Both developers checked others work and helped where it was needed.
