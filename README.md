# Gramina-stud
Gramina Stud webpage. Done for real life use and for an assesment in "Introduction to computer sciences" course.
This webpage gives information about a stable located near Tartu, Estonia. The webpage is run on CSS, HTML and a little bit of JS.
It will have no framework and will probably stay as an alpha version for a live webpage.
